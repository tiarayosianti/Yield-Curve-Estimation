### Comparison of the Nelson-Siegel and Nelson-Siegel Svensson Models in Estimating the Yield Curve of the Republic of Indonesia's Government Bonds in 2022

**Objective**  
This project compares the Nelson-Siegel and Nelson-Siegel Svensson models in estimating the yield curve of government bonds in Indonesia. The goal is to determine which model provides more accurate results by comparing their Mean Squared Error (MSE) values, helping investors make informed decisions when buying government bonds.

**Data**  
The study uses government bond data from Indonesia for the period of January 2022 to September 2022. The dataset includes bond yields at different maturities, which are used to estimate the yield curve.

**Method**  
- **Nelson-Siegel Model**: A popular model for estimating the yield curve using a three-parameter model to represent the relationship between bond yield and maturity.  
- **Nelson-Siegel Svensson Model**: An extended version of the Nelson-Siegel model that adds two additional parameters to provide a more flexible and accurate fit for the yield curve.  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The performance of both models is evaluated using the MSE, with the model yielding the lower MSE considered to be more accurate.

**Results**  
- The **Nelson-Siegel Svensson model** provides a more accurate fit for the yield curve, with a lower MSE compared to the **Nelson-Siegel model**.  
- The MSE for the **Nelson-Siegel Svensson model** was **9.750024e-07**, while the MSE for the **Nelson-Siegel model** was **9.751698e-07**.
- These results demonstrate that the **Nelson-Siegel Svensson model** is more effective in modeling the yield curve of Indonesian government bonds during the observed period (January 2022 to September 2022).
